		<p>These are Used For Fruit Salad
Pine apples<br>

Pawpaw<br>

Water melon<br>

Oranges<br>

Grapes<br>

Banana<br>

These fruits can be used at any proportion; it all depends on what is available to you.<br>

Step 1

Peel off the back of the pawpaw, pineapples, oranges, and grapes, this part should be easy.<br>

Step 2

Then chop the pineapples/paw paw/watermelon to mouth-size bits with a kitchen knife and a clean tray.<br>

Step 3

Squeeze out the grape/orange juice and set aside in a cup.<br>

Nigerian fruits salad is just a mixture of all those fruits together,<br> and then just pour in the orange juice, serve with a spoon… and serve chilled.</p>

<h2>HOW OFTEN CAN I HAVE FRUIT SALAD?</h2>

<p>I think you should try a full plate of fruit salad often; at least once in a week.<br> It improves both psychological health and body fitness.

This page is completely about fruit salads,<br> I have spent the last few months exploring healthy Nigerian foods.

I have also written a couple of articles on the subject which<br> you have probably read if you are a member of the Nigerian Kitchen.</p>

<p>Passion fruit is a fragrant, tropical fruit that is loaded with Vitamin A and Vitamin C.<br> There are more than a hundred types of fruits in this species grown in different parts of the world. Of these,<br> the yellow and purple varieties are cultivated for commercial purposes.<br> Passion fruit is round to oval in shape and has a diameter of about 4 to 8 inches.<br> When the tough outer shell is slit,<br> the inside has a light yellow or orange color pulp with many dark-coloured edible seeds.<br>


So, that’s about some of the many types of fruits known to us!<br> There are many such fascinating fruits that come in unique shapes, sizes and tastes,<br> along with offering a cartload of health benefits to us.<br> Be sure to enjoy them in their peak harvest season and appreciate the wonders of nature!</p><br>

<p>Sometimes, I also combine just two or three fruits and serve.</p>




<p>I believe healthy foods are vital for the development and health of the body cells,<br> and we are as healthy as our body cells.

So what am I saying in a nutshell?

I say that fruits (as long as they are natural and fresh)<br>remain top on the list of healthy foods of all time.

Starting from apples to soursop, watermelons, cucumber, tomatoes, carrots, garden eggs,<br> they all play specific roles to our optimum health.

If you can flashback to the days of our forefather, <br>you remember they lived longer because they consumed mostly fresh foods from the farm and lived in a less polluted environment.

The story is not the same anymore,<br> today we live in polluted environments and eat processed nutrient-drained foods.<br>

We feed our kids with noodles, biscuits, ice cream and think less of fresh foods.<br>

Some of us don’t even know that Akamu (pap) is significantly better than custards.<br> Anyway, that is a talk for another day. 😀

A plate of fruits salad should comprise at least five of your most favorite fruits,<br> for me, it is usually, watermelon, oranges, pineapples, grapes,
bananas and sometimes mango and apples are also added as well.</p>

<p>Cherry is a drupe fruit that belongs to the family of prunus fruit varieties.<br> There are two major types of Cherries cultivated commercially – The sour cherries and the sweet cherries.<br> The Sour cherries are used for cooking and have tarty taste due to high acidic content.<br> The Sweet cherries are quite popular in many countries, where they are had as a whole or in the form of juice.<br> Cherries grow only in colder climates and cannot survive in tropical regions.</p><br>

<p>A pear is another sweet-tasting fruit that comes from the family of Rosaceae.<br> It is also one of the oldest cultivated types of fruits in the world<br> and is considered to be the “gift from the Gods” by the ancient Greeks.<br> Pear trees are medium-sized and typically grow in mild temperate countries like Europe,<br> Asia and North Africa. The inner flesh of these fruits contain edible seeds called the stone cells and the outer skin is slightly coarse in texture.<br> There are about 3000 varieties of pears, which come in different sizes, shapes, colors and tastes.</p><br>
